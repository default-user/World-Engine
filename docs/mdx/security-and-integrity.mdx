# Security & Integrity

## Threat Model

### Data Corruption

- **Snapshot integrity:** Content-addressed snapshots can be verified on load.
- **Event log integrity:** Hashed event segments detect tampering or truncation.
- **Rollback safety:** Rollback operations reconstruct state deterministically from verified data.

### Rollback Abuse

- **Edit branches:** Named branches allow experimentation without affecting the main timeline.
- **Commit model:** Explicit commits prevent accidental state loss.

### Provenance

- **Event records:** Every mutation is recorded with timestamp and source.
- **Audit trail:** The event log provides a complete history of world changes.

## Non-Goals (v0.1)

- Network security (no multiplayer in v0.1).
- DRM or content protection.
- Mass surveillance or always-on capture.

## Status

- **M0:** Document the threat model.
- **M2:** Implement snapshot and event log integrity checks.
