# Persistence

Persistence provides durable world state through snapshots and an append-only event log.

## Design

- **Snapshots:** Content-addressed CBOR blobs capturing full world state at a point in time.
- **Event log:** Append-only CBOR segments recording every mutation since the last snapshot.
- **Rollback:** Reconstruct prior state by loading a snapshot and replaying events.
- **Branching:** Create named edit branches for non-destructive experimentation.

## Invariants

- Event log is append-only.
- Snapshots are content-addressed and verifiable.
- Rollback reconstructs prior state via snapshot + log replay.

## Status

- **M0:** Crate scaffolding.
- **M2:** WorldManifest, RegionSnapshot, EventLog, save/load/rollback, golden tests.
