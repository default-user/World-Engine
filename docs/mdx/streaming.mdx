# Streaming

Streaming manages world partition, cell loading/unloading, and LOD budgets.

## Design

- **World partition grid:** Fixed-size cells covering the world.
- **Camera-relative streaming:** Cells load/unload based on distance from the active camera.
- **Async asset loading:** Cell data loads asynchronously to avoid frame hitches.
- **LOD budgets:** Level-of-detail transitions managed per cell.

## Terrain (v0.1)

- Heightfield chunks (256x256 samples).
- Compressed per-chunk storage.
- Voxel hybrid deferred to later milestones.

## Invariants

- No frame hitching by design goal; measure and regress.
- Cells load/unload without corrupting world truth.

## Status

- **M0:** Crate scaffolding.
- **M4:** Terrain chunks, partition grid, cell streaming, perf benchmarks.
