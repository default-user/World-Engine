# In-World Authoring

Authoring tools allow users to modify the world from within, with full undo/redo support.

## Design

- **Non-destructive edits:** All operations are reversible by default.
- **Event records:** Every authoring operation produces an event for persistence and replay.
- **Commit model:** Edits accumulate in a working set and can be committed with a name.
- **Undo/redo stack:** Standard linear undo with redo support.

## Planned Operations (M3)

- Place object
- Delete object
- Transform object (move, rotate, scale)
- Undo / Redo
- Commit edit block

## Invariants

- All authoring ops are reversible.
- Every authoring op produces an event record.

## Status

- **M0:** Crate scaffolding.
- **M3:** Place, delete, transform, undo/redo, commit, event records.
