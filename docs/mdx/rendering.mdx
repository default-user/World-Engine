# Rendering

The rendering module provides a renderer-agnostic interface with a wgpu backend.

## Design

- **Adapter pattern:** The render module defines traits; backends implement them.
- **wgpu backend:** Initial backend using the wgpu crate for cross-platform GPU access.
- **Read-only world access:** The renderer derives visual state from world state but never mutates it.

## Invariants

- Renderer cannot mutate world truth directly.
- Render state derives from world state and view parameters.

## Note on Photorealism

v0.1 does not reimplement photoreal rendering from scratch. Photorealism is achieved through
asset quality, lighting model improvements, and later renderer plugins. The focus is on correct
world truth, persistence, authoring, and a competent renderer adapter.

## Status

- **M0:** Crate scaffolding.
- **M1:** Basic renderer wiring, desktop window with camera.
